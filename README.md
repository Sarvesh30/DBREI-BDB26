## DBREI - Defensive Back Reactive Execution Index

In the NFL, the defensive back position is one of the most challenging positions in an offense-oriented league where DBs require patience, quick reaction, and strategic execution to prevent completions, but many metrics do not isolate what happens after the ball is released. Traditional metrics only cover statistics such as completions allowed by DBs without uncovering true DB movement and tracking.

DBREI (Defensive Back Reactive Execution Index)  quantifies DB reaction and execution efficiency while the ball is in the air. Through isolation of post-release movement from pre-release context, DBREI reflects which DBs excel when the race to the catch point begins.
